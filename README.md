##  About Me

I am an engineering student who completed my schooling up to 12th standard with good academic performance.  
Currently, I am pursuing my college education, where I am building a strong foundation in both core engineering subjects and programming skills.

Along with core subjects, I am actively developing my **coding skills, logical thinking, and problem-solving abilities**.  
I enjoy learning new technologies and applying my knowledge through practice and projects.

Currently, I am learning **Data Structures** to strengthen my programming and algorithmic skills.  
My ultimate goal is to become a skilled **Software Developer** and work on real-world applications.
